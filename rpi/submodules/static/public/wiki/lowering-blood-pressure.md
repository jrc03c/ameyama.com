Diet and exercise are obviously important for lowering blood pressure. But aside from those, here are a few other ideas that might help.

## Exercise

- Endurance
- Isometric (e.g., planks, leg lifts, etc.)

## Supplements

- **L-arginine:** 4g to 30g per day
- **Magnesium:** more than 300mg per day
- **Garlic:** usually 600mg to 900mg per day (but some trials went as high as 2400mg per day!)
- **Potassium:** 3500mg per day
- **Spirulina:** 1g to 8g per day
- **Calcium:** 1000mg to 1500mg per day

## Miscellaneous

- Tracking blood pressure in an app, website, or similar
- Mindfulness-based meditation
- Renal sympathetic denervation (for cases of sympathetic overdrive, which may not apply to me)
