title: Run a Node script as a process that never dies
tags: node, javascript, programming, web
---

```bash
nohup node script.js > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

1. `nohup` means: Do not terminate this process even when the stty is cut off.
2. `> /dev/null` means: stdout goes to /dev/null (which is a dummy device that does not record any output).
3. `2>&1` means: stderr also goes to the stdout (which is already redirected to /dev/null). You may replace &1 with a file path to keep a log of errors, e.g.: 2>/tmp/myLog
4. `&` at the end means: run this command as a background task.
