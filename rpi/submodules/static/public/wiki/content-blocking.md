For general blocking, I use the `/etc/hosts` files from:

- [someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/)
- [github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list](https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list)

(I just concatenate them.)

For browser-based blocking, I use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) with some additions:

- a custom filter list from [letsblock.it](https://letsblock.it)
- the Google account pop-up filter from [mig4ng/ublock-origin-filters](https://github.com/mig4ng/ublock-origin-filters#google-account-popup)
