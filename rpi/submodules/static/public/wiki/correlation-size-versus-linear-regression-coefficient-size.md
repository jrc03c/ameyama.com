title: Correlation size versus linear regression coefficient size

In a couple of work projects, I've used linear regression to predict a single dependent variables from many independent variables. In a few cases, the strength of the correlation between some particular independent variable and the dependent variable didn't seem to match the relative size of the coefficient learned in the model for that independent variable. I asked [Claude](https://claude.ai/) about it. Here's the conversation:

What might it mean if (for example) a particular independent variable correlates relatively strongly with the dependent variable but has a relatively small (i.e., close to zero) coefficient in the trained regression model? And what might it mean if the reverse is true: if the independent variable has a relatively low correlation (i.e., close to zero) with the dependent variable but has a relatively large coefficient in the model?

The effect of that variable is being "explained away" by the other collinear variables.

The relationship only emerges after accounting for the other variables.

> - Issues like overfitting can also cause coefficients to poorly reflect the true underlying relationships. The model may be tailored too closely to the particular sample data.

> So in summary, correlations show the overall bivariate relationships, while coefficients capture the specific isolated contribution accounting for the other variables. Discrepancies can arise due to collinearity, suppressor effects, overfitting, and other reasons. Carefully examining the analysis and data is needed to understand the cause.
