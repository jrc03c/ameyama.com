To whom it may concern:

I wish I had the right words for a reply to you; but according to those around me, none of them will ever be right. I can only make matters worse, they say. There's too much to lose and too little to gain, they say. And I am afraid, so very afraid, of reliving the horrors of the past. So I will whisper these thoughts into my little corner of the void.

I wish you could know the truth with certainty. I wish I could tell you how much I appreciate your words, how they've reassured and validated me. But I can't tell you. I am forced to remain silent.

This world, this life, isn't fair. I long for you to find peace about the past. I'm glad you've found a little bit of happiness in the present. I hope you keep it for a long, long time.
