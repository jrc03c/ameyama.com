title: Notes Update

I updated the [Notes](/blog/2018/01/18/Notes) app, and you can see the live version [here](/notes). I went away from that project for a long time and tried to use other note-taking apps. In the end, they all still rubbed me the wrong way. So, I rebuilt my Notes app again, this time using [Direbase](/blog/2018/10/03/Direbase) and ensuring that the notes were end-to-end encrypted. I'm not a crypto expert, and some of the functionality is still under construction --- so use with caution. The source is [here](https://gitlab.com/jrc03c/notes) if you want to dig through it or host your own instance!
