UPDATE: You can play the WEBGL version of the game [here](/red).

Hey! So, I made a game called _Red_. It's a retelling of the "Little Red Riding Hood" story. I guess you'll just have to play it if you want to find out how it differs from the original. :) I originally planned to submit it for Ludum Dare 39, but we were travelling and spending time with family and whatever, and I just ran out of time. But, anyway, here it is! You can download it from [the itch.io page](https://jrc03c.itch.io/red). Enjoy!

By the way, I made the game using Unity, Audacity, Reaper, Piskel, and GIMP. The source is [over on GitHub](http://github.com/jrc03c/red).
