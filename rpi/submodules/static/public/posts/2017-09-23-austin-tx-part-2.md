Today was so much fun!

Larry Wilmore's show, _Black on the Air_, hosted special guest Cecile Richards. She was cool, and Larry was hilarious (of course). Great, great show.

Then, as we were walking around the UT campus, I had a severely lame moment. Deray Mckesson was walking towards us on the sidewalk! I froke out. I really wanted to say something him, especially since he wasn't surrounded by a mob of people, but I couldn't think of anything in time. As he walked past, I lamely said, "I love your podcast!" He turned, smiled, said, "Thanks," and kept walking. I really should've tried to shake his hand or something. He's so cool. A little while later, we were able to see him, Cecile Richards, and Ezra Levin in a panel on "The Resistance."

Finally, we got to see Ana Marie Cox and her guest Michael Steele for a live recording of the _With Friends Like These_ podcast. I didn't much care for Michael Steele, but it was still a good show. (NOTE: I even asked a question, so you might be able to hear me on the episode when it comes out!)

Anyway, we had so much fun. I'm so glad that we had the opportunity to go!
