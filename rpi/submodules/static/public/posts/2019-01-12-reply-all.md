To whom it may concern,

You wrote a letter to me a few days ago. It was beautiful and sweet: a virtual hug, a reminder that I'm not forgotten. Your words, along with the words of others who have written to me over the past several months, have meant more to me than you can ever know. You have all given me light during the darkest hours.

It breaks my heart that I can't reply. There are a host of reasons, but the net result of them is that I'm afraid to respond to any of you. You must think that I'm ignoring you, but I'm not. I hear and cherish every word. You'll never know how your words have kept me afloat when I feared I would sink.

I know you'll probably never find this letter; I'm just out here mumbling in my own little corner of the void. But if you ever do find this: thank you.
