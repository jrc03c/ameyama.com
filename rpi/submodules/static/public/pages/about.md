Hey! My name is Josh. I mostly do programming things these days, but I've dabbled a bit in music, math, and poetry as well. I've written a book of poems called [_All the World to Me_](/all-the-world-to-me/), and I worked for a while on the [Public Domain Tapes](https://publicdomaintapes.com) podcast (though it has lately fallen by the wayside). I also have lots of little side [projects](/projects), most of which rarely see the light of day. I hope you find something useful here.
