> **NOTE:** So, I know it doesn't look like I've read a lot over the past year, but I've actually been reading on this particular book for over a year now! I'm sure it's possible to complete it much more quickly than that, but I could only take little bits at a time. And I mean that in a good way: the stories were so interesting, so dense, and so weird that I needed to go away and ponder each one for a while before feeling ready for the next one. Anyway, I loved this anthology and can't recommend it highly enough!
