## Gentle Exorcism

A ghost haunts the blue rooms<br>
I see your face in mirrors<br>
Burn the sage and sweet grass<br>
Light the white candles<br>
Sprinkle rice and then salt<br>
It hurts to be turned away from the door<br>
May the rain wash us clean<br>
May the wet earth uphold our feet<br>
May a bright hearth warm us<br>
May we both find peace and rest

## Villanelle #1

The boys in green; they in the ground a-lay<br>
Along the purple road into the night<br>
The battle no-one won was on that day

Upon the major's brows was flecked with gray<br>
The sorrows of the sullen, silly fight<br>
The boys in green; they in the ground a-lay

And poured like wine into the yellow clay<br>
The running reddened rivers of their fright<br>
The battle no-one won was on that day

These children chopped and charged into the fray<br>
Dissevered by the shards of silver spite<br>
The boys in green; they in the ground a-lay

Amid the chaos, one, I heard him say,<br>
"Lord, wash us with thy blood and make us white!"<br>
The battle no-one won was on that day

And when the blackened bullets them a-slay<br>
The Lord done took 'em home into the light<br>
The boys in green; they in the ground a-lay<br>
The battle no-one won was on that day

## Tankas

### #1

The temple bell's call<br>
Dances on cherry blossoms<br>
In the fresh spring breeze.<br>
Let us go to the village<br>
Together, my sweet daughter!

### #2

See the silver fish<br>
Glittering in the river?<br>
He fancies himself<br>
Lord of the Rushing Currents,<br>
Dancing in the flashing sun.

### #3

Her hair falls smoothly,<br>
Like a jet black waterfall â€”<br>
Raven ink spilling<br>
Darkly on the porcelain<br>
White, snowy slope of her neck.

### #4

The little bird arcs,<br>
Tumbles in the bitter blast<br>
From the leaden clouds.<br>
Why is life so hard, my friend?<br>
All you want is your warm nest!

## Untitled #3

Pencil almost touching paper<br>
What to say?<br>
Clouds slide over the sun<br>
Swirling voices blur

Colors and lights<br>
Pencil and paper<br>
What to say?

Shadows and sleep<br>
Pencil and paper<br>
What to say?

Heart not beating yet<br>
What to say?<br>
Am I almost alive yet?<br>
Is it time?
