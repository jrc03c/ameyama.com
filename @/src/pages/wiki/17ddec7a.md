### Physical preparation

1. Don't eat for a few hours before the run.
2. Take some Tums right before the run.

### Mental preparation:

1. Schedule a time for the run and stick to it.
2. Set a goal (e.g., time, distance, pushing through pain, enjoying scenery, etc.).
3. Create a mantra (e.g., "I am strong") or a visualization (e.g., running freely and effortlessly) to ponder before or during the run.
4. Approach the run with excitement or anticipation rather than dread or a sense of obligation, guilt, or shame.
5. Keep long-term goals and benefits in mind (e.g., weight loss, reduced blood pressure, reduced anxiety, increased libido, etc.).
6. Work with an accountability partner.
7. Take baby steps.

> ğŸ’¡ Remember: it's all about taking the small steps that will lead to the big picture.
