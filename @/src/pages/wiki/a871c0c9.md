The option to take quick screenshots that (1) don't launch the Spectacle GUI and (2) copy the resulting image to the clipboard _do not exist_ for some unknown reason in KDE. I had to create custom keyboard shortcuts that invoked the following commands in order to achieve that functionality.

```bash
# copy fullscreen screenshot to clipboard
spectacle -bcf

# copy manually-selected rectangular region to clipboard
spectacle -bcr
```
