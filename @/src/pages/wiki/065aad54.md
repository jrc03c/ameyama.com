I recently installed and tried to use the Flatpak version of OBS Studio in Fedora Kinoite. Kinoite uses KDE as its desktop environment, and KDE uses Wayland as its graphics platform. For whatever reason, OBS's keyboard shortcuts wouldn't work in this context. The solution I found is this: Simply disable Wayland windowing in OBS's settings via Flatseal!
