**NOTE:** For all of the commands below, using `gpg` seems to work just as well as `gpg2`.

1. Fetch the Qubes Master Signing Key:

```bash
gpg2 --fetch-keys https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc
```

2. List the keys you currently have and find the ID of the QMSK:

```bash
gpg2 -k
```

3. Verify the fingerprint of the QMSK by comparing it to multiple independent sources:

```bash
gpg2 --fingerprint <QMSK_ID>
```

4. Set the QMSK's trust level to "ultimate":

```bash
gpg2 --edit-key <QMSK_ID>
```

The above command opens a little GPG REPL. In there, do:

```
fpr
trust
q
```

And then confirm that the trust level was applied correctly:

```bash
gpg2 -k "Qubes Master Signing Key"
```

5. Download the release signing key that corresponds to the ISO you downloaded. (Usually, the signing key is listed right below the ISO file link on the downloads page.) Be sure to replace the dummy filename below with the signing key's actual filename.

```bash
gpg2 --keyserver-options no-self-sigs-only,no-import-clean --import path/to/qubes-release-X-signing-key.asc
```

6. Confirm that the release signing key was signed by the master key:

```bash
gpg2 --check-signatures "Qubes OS Release X Signing Key"
```

7. Make sure that the release signing key has "full" trust:

```bash
gpg2 -k "Qubes OS Release X Signing Key"
```

8. Download the hash values that correspond to the ISO you downloaded. (Usually, the hash values file is listed right below the ISO file link on the downloads page.) Be sure to replace the dummy filename below with the `.DIGESTS` file's actual filename.

```bash
sha512sum -c path/to/Qubes-X-x86_64.iso.DIGESTS
```

You should see something like:

```
Qubes-X-x86_64.iso: OK
sha512sum: WARNING: 23 lines are improperly formatted
```

9. Verify that the `.DIGESTS` file was signed by the release signing key:

```bash
gpg2 -v --verify path/to/Qubes-X-x86_64.iso.DIGESTS
```
