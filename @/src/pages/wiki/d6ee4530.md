The `fileinput` module's `input` method reads in files one line at a time:

```py
import fileinput

for line in fileinput.input(["somefile.txt"]):
	print(line)
```

**BONUS:** How to read a large CSV in chunks:

```python
import pandas as pd

# `chunksize` specifies the number of rows in each chunk
chunksize = 10000

with pd.read_csv("big.csv", chunksize=chunksize) as reader:
  for chunk in reader:
    print(chunk)
```
