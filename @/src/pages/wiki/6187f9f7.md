This list comes from [here](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/top-20-things-that-make-people-feel-good-and-new-positivity-bench-in-london/). I doubt it's very rigorous, but I also haven't looked into it too closely. It seems plausible, but take it with a grain of salt.

1. A good night's sleep
2. A sunny blue sky
3. Summer
4. Receiving a compliment or praise
5. Booking a holiday
6. Crying with laughter
7. Getting a quiet moment to yourself
8. Eating your favorite snack
9. Pets being happy to see you
10. Looking back at old photographs
11. Finishing a great book
12. Helping an elderly person with something
13. Finishing a workout
14. Hearing children really belly-laughing
15. Finding a parking space when it's busy
16. A newly-cleaned car
17. When your football or other sports team wins
18. A heart-to-heart with a loved one
19. Volunteering or helping others
20. Finding out your children have done well at school
