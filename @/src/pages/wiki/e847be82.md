### Get a function name as a string:

```python
my_func.__name__
```

### Pad a string:

```python
# padding on the left
print("234".rjust(10, "0"))
# 0000000234

# padding on the right
print("234".ljust(10, "0"))
# 2340000000
```

### Regular expressions (regex)

```python
import re

# create a pattern
whitespace = re.compile("\\s")

# find the first occurrence of a pattern
whitespace.search("Hello, world!")
# <re.Match object; span=(6, 7), match=' '>

# find all occurrences of a pattern
whitespace.findall("It was the best of times...")
# [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']

# capture
# (note: i had to insert extra back-slashes here because eleventy threw a fit
# about the curly braces. you'll probably need to remove them when you actually
# run this code!)
pattern = re.compile("\{\{\\s*(.*?)\\s*\}\}", re.S)
match = pattern.search("I am \{\{ age \}\} years old.")
print(match.group(1))
# 'age'

# multiple flags can be combined with the bit-wise OR operator:
pattern = re.compile("whatever", re.M | re.S)

# it's also possible to use regular expressions without compiling them first:
print(re.findall(r"\s", "It was the best of times..."))
# [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']
```

### Use getters, setters, and deleters:

```python
class Foo:
  def __init__(self):
    self._value = None

  @property
  def value(self):
    return self._value

  @value.setter
  def value(self, new_value):
    self._value = new_value

  @value.deleter
  def value(self):
    del self._x
```

### Read an environment variable:

```python
import os
print(os.environ["WHATEVS"])
```

### Check if a file or folder exists:

```python
import os
print(os.path.exists("/some/path"))
```

### Check if a path is a file or folder:

```python
import os
print(os.path.isfile("/some/path"))
print(os.path.isdir("/some/path"))
```

### Get the size of a file:

```python
import os
print(os.path.getsize("/path/to/file"))
```

### Pad numbers:

```python
print("{:07d}".format(3))
# 0000003
```

### Get the absolute path of a script:

```python
__file__
```

> **NOTE:** In the above example, `__file__` returns the path to the script _in which that variable name is referenced_, not the path of the script that was invoked. For example, consider the following situation. At the root of a project, I have a script called `foo.py` that imports a function from `a/b/c/bar.py` in the same project. The function in `a/b/c/bar.py` references `__file__`. Like this:
>
> ```python
> # foo.py
> from a.b.c.bar import bar
> bar()
> ```
>
> ```python
> # a/b/c/bar.py
> def bar():
>   print(__file__)
> ```
>
> ```bash
> python foo.py
> # /path/to/project/a/b/c/bar.py
> ```

### Get the absolute path of the directory containing a script:

```python
import os
dir = (os.path.sep).join(__file__.split(os.path.sep)[:-1])
```

> **NOTE:** See the note in the previous section regarding `__file__`.

### Run an external (e.g., Bash) command:

```python
import process
command = "ls -la"
subprocess.run(command, shell=True, executable="/bin/bash")
```

> **NOTE:** According to [this](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/python-run-bash-command) article: "If we pass a single string as a command to `subprocess.run()`, then the value of the argument must be `True` for the `shell` parameter. Otherwise, we must pass the command as a list of strings, and `shell` must be `False`."

### Serialize and deserialize an object:

```python
import pickle

my_obj = { "hello": "world" }

# note the "wb" argument:
with open("my_file.pkl", "wb") as file:
  pickle.dump(my_obj, file, protocol=5)

# note the "rb" argument:
with open("my_file.pkl", "rb") as file:
  my_new_obj = pickle.load(file)
```

> **NOTE:** There are serious security implications involved in this ☝️ process. The sklearn ["Model persistence"](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html) page has a good summary of the different serialization tools.

> **NOTE:** Also note that deserialization (at least with `pickle`) will fail if any of the relevant resources haven't yet been loaded. For example, if the object being deserialized has a property pointing to a function called `foo`, then `foo` must be loaded _before_ deserialization can occur.
