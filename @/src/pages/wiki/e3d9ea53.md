1. Create the user who should run the service, or choose an existing one.

2. Copy the system syncthing@.service file into the load path of the system instance. Replace `<user>` with the name of the user who'll own the service.

```bash
sudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/syncthing@.service /etc/systemd/system/syncthing@<user>.service
```

(NOTE: The above paths make sense in Ubuntu, but they may not be correct in other Linux distros.)

3. Enable and start the service. Replace `<user>` with the actual Syncthing user after the @:

```bash
systemctl enable syncthing@<user>.service
systemctl start syncthing@<user>.service
```
