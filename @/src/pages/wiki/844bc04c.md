Transpilation fails when bundling `js-math-tools` with Vite because the library uses `BigInt` in some of its calculations. To fix this, add these settings to the `vite.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    target: "es2020",
  },

  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      target: "es2020",
    },
  },
}
```

Since this solution was actually found in the SvelteKit GitHub repo's issues list, it may be the case that this solution will work for other bundlers, perhaps with minimal tweaks.
