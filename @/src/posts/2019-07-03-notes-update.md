I updated the [Notes](#) (💀) app, and you can see the live version [here](#) (💀). I went away from that project for a long time and tried to use other note-taking apps. In the end, they all still rubbed me the wrong way. So, I rebuilt my Notes app again, this time using [Direbase](https://gitlab.com/jrc03c/direbase) and ensuring that the notes were end-to-end encrypted. I'm not a crypto expert, and some of the functionality is still under construction --- so use with caution. The source is [here](https://gitlab.com/jrc03c/notes) if you want to dig through it or host your own instance!
