UPDATE: _Prisoners' Dilemma_ won [first place in the innovation category for LD34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=65569)!

[_Prisoners' Dilemma_](#) (ðŸ’€) is a two-player game played across the Internet. It was made for Ludum Dare in December 2015 and implements the "two-button controls" theme. If two players are present, then they are placed in a prison together. The only way that they can communicate with each other is by knocking on the wall that separates their cells (using the **K** key on the keyboard). They can also attempt to escape (with the **D** key), but will be killed in the attempt unless they synchronize their attacks and each take down a guard. The difficulty of the game, then, comes from the fact that it's quite hard to synchronize an attack when you have no means of communication other than knocking on a wall.

_Prisoners' Dilemma_ was made with [p5js](http://p5js.org/) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
