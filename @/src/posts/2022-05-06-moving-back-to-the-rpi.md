I hosted this site on Vercel for a while, but honestly, I really miss running my own server. Not so much because I like the constant gardening, but because I just love the flexibility of being able to use it however I want. Anyway, I've started the process of moving everything back to my Raspberry Pi, so the site might be off and on over the next few days.
