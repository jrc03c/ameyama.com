Hey, everyone! I just wanted to let you know that a friend and I launched a site called [Visible Peeps](https://visiblepeeps.net/). It's a site where artists and designers from the [#visiblewomen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VisibleWomen) and [#visiblenb](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VisibleNB) movements can submit their tweets for indexing by professional category and level. Hopefully, it'll also act as a place where people in need of artists can go to find women, non-binary, and trans people for hire.

I did all of the JavaScript (Vue & Firebase) stuff on the site, and [Andreas Werchmeister](https://twitter.com/a_werchmeister) did all of the design / CSS stuff. I've had so much fun collaborating on this project! Enjoy!
