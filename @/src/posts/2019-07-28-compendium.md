So, as you may know, I'm part of a [webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/). But a fun fact about the webring is that some people in that little community have wikis. And an even more fun fact is that we've agreed to start using a common data format, [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#indental), for our wikis. This means that it's now possible and even easy to parse and compile those wikis into a single larger wiki---which is what I've done with a new tool I've made called [Compendium](https://gitlab.com/jrc03c/compendium)! Compendium is an offline-first compilation of the webring's wikis, and it's browsable via the command line! Have a look at the docs to get started!

Also note that the webring's founder, [@neauoire](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#devine+lu+linvega), made a similar tool [here](https://webring.xxiivv.com/wiki.html) for use in the web browser.

Enjoy!
